## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Project Rootly seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps to report it to us safely.

### **DO NOT** open a public issue on GitHub.

Publicly reporting a security bug can put the community at risk. Instead, please report it privately:

1.  **Email**: Send a detailed report to **security@example.com** (please replace this with your actual security email).
2.  **Details**: Include identifying information such as:
    *   Description of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce the issue.
    *   Potential impact.
    *   Any relevant code snippets or proof-of-concept.

### Our Response

*   We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.
*   We will investigate the issue and communicate our findings to you.
*   We will work to fix the vulnerability and release a patch as soon as possible.
*   We will credit you for your discovery (unless you wish to remain anonymous) in our release notes once the fix is public.

Thank you for helping keep Project Rootly safe!
